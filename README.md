# Installation

Define the evironment variable ZEEGUU_API. 

If you have zeeguu_api running locally and you're on Linux/Mac you'll do:   

    export ZEEGUU_API=http://localhost:9001

If you're on a Mac all you need to do to have the web running is: 

    ./install.sh
    ./start_web.sh
    
If you're not on a Mac, look in the two files `./install.sh` and `./start_web.sh`.
Do the equivalent steps in those files for your own OS.
